## 3/21/2018 - ml-100k test
Test parameters:
ml-100k; 4 algorithms (SVD and KNN w/ 3 different similarities); 100 individual users
In total, this is 400 runs
Took 691.9 seconds (10.3 minutes)
This means each ml-100k run took ~1.7 seconds.

## 3/21/2018 - ml-1m test
Test parameters:
ml-1m; 2 algorithms (SVD and KNN item w/ msd similarity); 100 individual users
In total, this is 200 runs
5666.7 seconds (94.5 minutes)
1 run = 2 minutes
